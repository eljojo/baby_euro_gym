# Baby Euro Gym

Welcome to Baby Euro Gym.  
Today you'll learn how to write a **GameBoy emulator in Ruby**. More or less.

## How does this work?
This tutorial is a work in progress.  
By the end of the tutorial, you should:

- Be familiar with the internals of emulators
- Know how a real life GameBoy works (more or less)
- Have your own emulator (that is capable of rendering the first frame of a game)
- Have a small idea of how to continue developing the emulator
- Have spent a nice saturday afternoon writing [irresponsible ruby](http://ajipirijou.com/talks/how-i-built-my-own-tpp-part-4/)

Buckle up, Billy, because this train has no *rails*!

## Why the name?
*Baby Euro Gym* is an anagram for *GameBoy Ruby*.
